# MCMC Visualizer


This project was inspired from this [blog post](https://tchristos.com/post/mcmc/) by Christos Tsanikidis. In Christo's work he built a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain visualizer and specifically built the program for metropolis-hastings. His program was very impressive and given that there wasn't too much explanation of how he achieved the end result, I decided to give it a try myself. My visualizer only works on 2 gaussian distributions which represent the x and y dimensions. The means and standard deviations can be changed for both distributions.


## How to run

1. Simply clone the repo.  

```$: git clone https://github.com/TylerMorton/MCMC-Visualizer.git``` 

2. Go into the MCMC-Visualizer directory  

```$: cd MCMC-Visualizer``` 

3. and run the project.  

```$: cargo run```
